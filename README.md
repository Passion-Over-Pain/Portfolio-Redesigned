# Project Documentation: Online Individual

As part of the **IWDV202 Semester Assignment 1**, I developed a professional online profile that represented my digital work. This project aimed to demonstrate my ability to integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/JQuery using modern tools and design principles. Below is the detailed structure of the project:

---

## Tools and Technologies
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio Code was used to create and manage the project files.  
- **Template Source**: A responsive and professional template was downloaded from [BootstrapMade](https://bootstrapmade.com/) and customized for this project.

> [!NOTE] 
> The project emphasized tailoring a pre-designed template to match individual branding, showcasing creativity and technical skills.
